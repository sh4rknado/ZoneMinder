# ZoneMinder Modification of Events

Intro:

During the project I would like to use Facial Recognizion/Object Detection/Plate Recognizion
for reduce the my event generated by ZM Event and I would like to gain the disk space too.

I have 6 Monitors in my House and I received all event but the Image is not really interesting.

ex :
    - change of brightness
    - camera activates infrared
    - cat/dog that pass in front of the camera
    - ...

that is why I would like to use in my solution :
    - Facial Recognizion (not notified if it's me or my family)
    - Object Detection (Detect if a car is in my hall, and detect the plate of car)
    - Plate Recognizion (not notified if it's me or my family)

- Types of FaceDetector
 -> OPENCV HaarCascades
 -> OPENCV DNN (TensorFlow/Caffe)
 -> DLIB HoG
 -> DLIB MMOD


# OpenCV DNN supports 2 networks
1. FP16 version of the original caffe implementation ( 5.4 MB )
2. 8 bit Quantized version using Tensorflow ( 2.7 MB )
I advise to choose TensorFlow with GPU/CPU
